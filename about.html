    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This website has been built by Ettore M. G. Trainiti as a personal initiative. </br>
      The idea behind this website was in the air for a while and further discussions with Lukas Larazek definitely reinforced the need of making such website available for the CS community. </br>
      The feedback coming from the CS Community Building Survey of Winter 2020 reinforced this need. </br>
      So here it is :)
    </p>

    <h2>How was this website built?</h2>
    <p> This website has been built using <a target="blank" href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 4</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/Jekyll">Jekyll</a>, Google Calendar, and few custom CSS rules.</p>
    <p>
      The website is hosted on <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, which has full support for Jekyll.</br>
      If you want to know more about how Jekyll makes things easier, check <a target="_blank" href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">this</a> great tutorial. 
    </p>

    <h2>How can I contribute to this website?</h2>
    <p>
      The first step to contribute is to make sure you can run this website locally on your machine. </br>
      If you know what you're doing, or you wanna start an adventure, I won't hold you back. </br>
      If you're new to this, then maybe follow these steps to run WatsUp CS locally on your machine:
    <ol>
      <li>Install <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a></li>
      <li>Install <a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">Jekyll</a></li>
      <li>Clone/Fork the WatsUp CS Git Repository</li>
      <li>Run "jekyll serve --watch" in the root directory of the WatsUp Git Repository</li>
      <li>Type "http://127.0.0.1:4000/" on your browser</li>
      <li>If everything looks right you are now good to go!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You can now create a new page starting from the content available in template.html. </br>
      Copy the template.html file, rename it, and add content to it. </br>
      Feel free to work on your page until you're done and you're happy about its content and its look. 
    </p>

    
    <h2>Few conventions to follow</h2>
    <p>
      Here's a list of conventions to follow to have a coherent experience across all the website pages:
      <ul>
        <li>Links to pages external to this website should open in a new tab</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>My new content is ready, what now?</h2>
    <p>
      When your changes are ready for submission and revision, submit a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request">git pull request</a>.
